currently i have jitter / lag whenever i press a button. this reduces the frames per second and is noticable. follow GEMINI.md and update snake.py to fix this issue.

implement ai (algorithm, not RL) to play the snake game by itself

implement logic to speed up game state update over time and watch snake play
